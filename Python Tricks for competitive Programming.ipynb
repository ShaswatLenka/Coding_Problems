    "## The most_common function of the Counter Package.\n",
    "This is probably the most useful function Iâ€™ve ever used and its always at the back of my mind while writing any python code. This function analyses a list/string and helps to return the top n entities in the list/string according to their number of occurences in descending order where n is a number that is specified by the programmer. The individual entities are returned along with their number of occurences in a tuple which can easily be reffered/printed as and when required."
